# Shape Creator

This project is a simple web application that allows users to create shapes of different colors and add them to a grid. The shapes are created based on the user's selection from a dropdown menu. The color of the shape is also selected by the user from a dropdown menu. The created shapes are added to a grid and the user can create up to 25 shapes.

## Features

- Shape selection: Users can select the shape they want to create from a dropdown menu. The available shapes are Circle, Square, and Triangle.
- Color selection: Users can select the color of the shape they want to create from a dropdown menu. The available colors are Blue, Green, Orange, Pink, and Purple.
- Shape creation: Once the user has selected a shape and color, they can create the shape by clicking the "Create" button. The created shape is added to a grid.
- Shape limit: The user can create up to 25 shapes. Once the limit is reached, the "Create" button is disabled and a message is displayed to the user.
- Shape information: When a shape in the grid is clicked, information about the shape is displayed. This includes the position of the shape in the grid and the color of the shape.
